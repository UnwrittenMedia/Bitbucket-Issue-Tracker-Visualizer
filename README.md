Bitbucket-Issue-Tracker-Visualizer
==================================

A simple way of viewing bitbucket issues in an interactive datatable, and exporting to excel.

See the [live demo](http://cunneen.github.io/Bitbucket-Issue-Tracker-Visualizer) . You can paste your own issues JSON export.

Currently it only looks at the issues list. Other data (comments, watchers etc) is currently ignored, but it should be trivial to modify the code to handle it.

Pull requests are welcome.
