Bitbucket-Issue-Tracker-Visualizer
==================================

A simple way of viewing bitbucket issues in an interactive datatable, and exporting to excel.

(Coming soon:) See the [live demo](http://cunneen.github.io/Bitbucket-Issue-Tracker-Visualizer) . You can paste your own issues JSON export.

If the live demo is not working, you can just [download the zip file from here](https://github.com/cunneen/Bitbucket-Issue-Tracker-Visualizer/archive/gh-pages.zip), extract all files and open the index.html in your browser.

Currently it only looks at the issues list. Other data (comments, watchers etc) is currently ignored, but it should be trivial to modify the code to handle it.

Pull requests are welcome.
